## Algorithm Timer
**Project Summary:** My final project Algorithm Timer is an extension, with the two main data structures being Graphs and Binary Search Trees. My extension is adding several algorithms for sorting through the Graph such as Depth First Search recursive, Depth First Search iterative, Breadth First Search - shortest path, Breadth First Traversal, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and taking the time of how long each algorithm takes to complete. The user is prompted to enter in a word they want to sort to for each respective algorithm, and then the algorithm runs and the time taken is printed out in nanoseconds. After this is done, the user is presented with a few options from the Binary Search Tree, where they are displayed the maximum and minimum nodes, and given the option to print the Binary Search Tree out in three different ways.

 **How To Run:** Click the green 'Download' in the top right hand corner, then 'Download Zip'. Right click the folder and extract all. Open this folder with VSCode (to examine code and make changes/comments/etc.) (or if you want to just run the code navigate to the folder with your Terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS, Terminal on Linux), and then in your terminal, type './a test.txt'. After this is done, the instructions for what you need to enter will be displayed.
 
 **Dependencies:** No special library is required, only the Mingw C++ compiler.

**System Requirements:** The Mingw C++ compiler, and a terminal. Works across macOS, Windows, and Linux.
